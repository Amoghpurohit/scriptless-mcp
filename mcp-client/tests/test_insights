things to change from running steps - 
ask the LLM to not be too strict with result Analysis
if instructions has scoll in it, its likely for visual validation for user dont verify playwright code for it
receiving click action was accepted is sufficient to pass the step in most cases, you do not need confirmation everytime as there might not be one everytime.


NEXT STEPS - 
SYS CACHE - COST
TACKLE SLOWNESS BY MODEL CHANGE OR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE - TIME
SERVER PINGING - ITS TOO OFTEN AND UNNECESSARY RIGHT NOW

include total time in meta in min:sec

give the LLM only as little/precise info as it needs to judge the pass_fail param


debugging order - 

check if the sse_event has given the snapshot/page state
